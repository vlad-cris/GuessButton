This is an implementation from learn.wellcode.ro, with this tasks:

```
The hidden button
Let's create a page that contains 3 buttons. On page load, one of the buttons will be randomly chosen as the winner and the rest of the buttons as losers.

The user viewing the page will click on the buttons. Display an appropriate message when each button is pressed (winner or non-winner).

Bonus
Create an input and a button to generate.

The user will enter a number n, and when the button is pressed, n buttons will be generated. One of the n buttons will be the winner (chosen at random).

Display the corresponding message when each button is pressed.
